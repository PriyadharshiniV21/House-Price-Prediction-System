# House Price Prediction System

In the House Price Prediction System project, I delved into the analysis of the Bengaluru House Prices dataset, employing a comprehensive approach to data preprocessing. Using the pandas library, I conducted tasks such as data cleaning, feature selection, feature engineering, and outlier detection and removal to ensure the dataset's quality and relevance. For effective visualization, I leveraged the matplotlib library.

In the machine learning phase, I employed the scikit-learn library to build a predictive model for house prices. Utilizing Linear Regression for model training, I rigorously evaluated the model's performance using key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. Impressively, the model achieved a commendable accuracy score of 87%.

To make the model accessible and practical, I saved it in a pickle file for easy retrieval. Taking it a step further, I developed a user-friendly web application using Streamlit for seamless model deployment. This not only showcased the functionality of the predictive model but also demonstrated its practical application through an intuitive and interactive interface. The project not only highlights my proficiency in Python, Machine Learning, and Streamlit but also underscores my meticulous approach to data analysis and model deployment.
